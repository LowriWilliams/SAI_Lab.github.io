title: "Evaluating and Improving the Robustness of National Highwaysâ€™ AI-based Systems"
summary: "The safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians on national highways is critical, but increasing traffic volume has led to a rise in accidents and fatalities. This project investigates the trustworthiness of applying AI in intelligent transport systems, and subsequently proposes a comprehensive framework for evaluating the performance and robustness of AI systems for intelligent roads."
